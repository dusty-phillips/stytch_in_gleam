# stytch_client

This package contains a simple type to hold the [Stytch](https://stytch.com)
authentication platform's login credentials, and functions to access various
platform APIs with those credentials.

At the moment, only magic link auth is supported.

There is an [example](../example) repository showing a complete full stack
lustre application working with this package.
